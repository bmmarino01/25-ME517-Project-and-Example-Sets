\subsection*{4--1. \textbf{Characterization with deflection history} [4 pts].} 
A simply supported beam is made from a material that is well-described by a three-parameter standard linear solid model, i.e., the general creep compliance function $J_c(t)$ is given by
\begin{equation*}
    J_c(t) = J_\infty + (J_0 - J_\infty) \exp\left[-\frac{t}{\tau_c}\right],
\end{equation*}
where $J_\infty$, $J_0$, and $\tau_c$ are all mechanical properties of the material. 



The beam has a length of 4 ft and a second moment of area about the out-of-plane axis of 1 in$^4$. 
It is subjected to a position-time separable load function $q(z,t) = \hat{q}(z) \phi(t)$ where $\phi(t) = -3$ lb/ft $\cdot \mathcal{H}(t)$. 
Say we determine the maximum deflection in the beam at different times to be
\begin{align}
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -0.6 \textrm{~in~~at~~}t=30\textrm{~min}\\
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -0.75 \textrm{~in~at~~}t=60\textrm{~min}\\
    &u_y \Big|_{\max} = -1.0 \textrm{~in~~at~~}\textrm{~long times}
    \end{align}
From this, calibrate the material properties.

Following the Beam organization that was demonstrated in class, we can use the solution found:
\begin{equation}
    u_y(z,t) = \frac{z^4-2Lz^3+L^3z}{24 I_x}\int_0^t \phi(t-\tau)\frac{dE_c^{-1}}{d\tau} d\tau
\end{equation}
First, we find where our $u_y$ max is, which is z = L/2. plugging in everything we know....
\begin{equation}
        u_y(t)_{max} = \frac{L^4/16-L^4/4+L^4/2}{24I_x }\int_0^t \phi(t-\tau)\frac{dE_c^{-1}}{d\tau} d\tau
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
        u_y(t)_{max} = 69120\int_0^t -36\mathcal{H}(t-\tau)\frac{J_0-J_{\infty}}{\tau_c}\exp[-\frac{t}{\tau_c}] d\tau
\end{equation}
taking our laplace transform and inverse transform gets us our final equation:
\begin{equation}
    u_y(t)_{max} = 2488320(J_0-J_{\infty})(1-\exp[-\frac{t}{\tau_c}])
\end{equation}
now, taking our three given initial conditions, we can assemble three equations
\begin{equation}
    u_y(30)_{max} = -.6  = 2488320(J_0-J_{\infty})(1-\exp[-\frac{30}{\tau_c}])
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    u_y(60)_{max} = -.75  = 2488320(J_0-J_{\infty})(1-\exp[-\frac{60}{\tau_c}])
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    u_y(\infty)_{max} = -1  = 2488320(J_0-J_{\infty})(1-\exp[-\frac{\infty}{\tau_c}])
\end{equation}

\subsection*{4--2. \textbf{Ramp up the torque} [4 pts].} 
A viscoelastic cylinder $AB$ is fixed on its end $A$ and simply supported on its opposite end at $B$. 
At point $B$, a second, rigid rod is joined to the end such that exerting a force on the rod will induce a counterclockwise torque about the axis of $AB$. 
A point force of magnitude $P_0$ is applied to the rigid rod, causing the front face to turn counterclockwise. 
The point force travels along the rod such that its distance from the bar's neutral axis $a(t)$ is direct in time, i.e., $a(t) = \alpha t$, where $\alpha$ is a constant. 
What is the angular rotation of the end $B$ as a function of time, $\Phi(t)$?

First, lets define some values we'll need to formulate our solution:
\begin{equation}
    L_{AB}, J_z, T_z(z,t),\mu_c^{-1}(t)
\end{equation}
where L is our length of the cylinder, $J_z$ is the polar moment of area, $\mu_c^{-1}$ is our shear compliance function and the torque, $T_z$ is define as follows:
\begin{equation}
    T_z = F*d
\end{equation}
where our force is given as a constant $P_0$ and the distance is given as a function of time:
\begin{equation}
    T_z = P_0 \alpha t
\end{equation}
now, with this, we can follow the derivation we used in class:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\theta}{dz}(z,t) = \frac{1}{J_z}\int_0^{t}T_z(t-\tau)\frac{d\mu_c^{-1}}{d\tau}d\tau
\end{equation}
plugging in everything we know:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\theta}{dz}(z,t) = \frac{1}{J_z}\int_0^{t}P_0\alpha(t-\tau)\frac{d\mu_c^{-1}}{d\tau}d\tau
\end{equation}
into laplace space we go:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\theta}{dz}(z,s) = \frac{P_0\alpha\mu_c^{-1}(s)}{J_zs^2}
\end{equation}
and back into real space:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\theta}{dz}(z,t) = 
\end{equation}
since there is no dependence on z...
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d\theta}{dz}(t) = \frac{P_0 \alpha t \mu_c^{-1}(t)}{J_z}
\end{equation}
and in order to find the total angular rotation, we need to convert our rate into rotation... using the length of the cylinder
\begin{equation}
    \boxed{\theta_B = \frac{P_0 \alpha t \mu_c^{-1}(t)}{J_z}*L_{AB}}
\end{equation}

\subsection*{4--3. \textbf{L-shaped beam} [4 pts].}

\end{wrapfigure}
A one-piece polymeric member \textit{ABC} consists of two segments of length $L$ at a right angle from one-another and encastred at $A$, as shown. 
Its neutral axes both lie in the $x-z$ plane when unloaded. 
Assuming the creep compliance in shear to be $\mu_c{t}$ and the creep compliance in axial tension to be $E_c(t)$, determine (a) the deflection at $C$ in terms of the time-varying force $F(t)$ and (b) the stress tensor $\mathbf{\sigma}(t)$ at the square surface element located above $A$.  

For this problem, we can consider the time varying portion as a linear sum of three distinct portions: Beam AB bending, Beam AB torsion, and Beam BC bending. First, we will derive beam bending based on a point load.
The max displacement for a cantilever beam is as follows:
\begin{equation}
    u_y(x) = \frac{FL^3}{3EI_z}
\end{equation}
following correspondence this switches to:
\begin{equation}
    
\end{equation}

\subsection*{4--4. \textbf{Fibrous material} [4 pts].}
An elastic material with a fiber phase has the Helmholtz free energy function
\begin{equation*}
\widetilde{\psi}(\bn{F}) = \frac{1}{2}C_{10} (I_1-3) + \frac{1}{4} k (I_a - 1)^2,
\end{equation*}
where $I_1(\bn{C}) = \textrm{tr}(\bn{C})$ and $I_a(\bn{C},\hat{\bm{a}}_0) = \hat{\bm{a}}_0 \cdot \bn{C} \hat{\bm{a}}_0$ for $\bn{C} = \bn{F}^\intercal \bn{F}$.

\subsection*{4--5. \textbf{Gent model of rubber elasticity} [4 pts].}
The Gent model, which incorporates the finite extensibility of polymer chains in a rubber network but includes $I_2$-dependence, has a free-energy function of $$\bar{\Psi} = -\frac{C_{10}}{2} J_m \ln \left(1 - \frac{I_1-3}{J_m} \right) + C_{01}\ln \left(\frac{I_2}{3}\right), $$ where $C_{10}>0$, $C_{01}\geq 0$, and $J_m>0$ are material constants.

\medskip
(a) Show that the Cauchy stress corresponding to the free energy above has the form $$\bm{\sigma} = -p \bn{I} + \frac{C_{10} J_m}{J_m - (I_1-3)}\bn{B} - \frac{2C_{01}}{I_2} \bn{B}^{-1}.$$

\medskip
(b) This material undergoes a simple shear deformation of magnitude $\gamma$. Given that the shear modulus $\mu(\gamma^2) \equiv \beta_1(\gamma^2) - \beta_{-1} (\gamma^2)$ where $\beta_i$ corresponds to the expression for $\bm{\sigma}$ in Q1, show that in the small strain limit that $$\lim\limits_{\gamma \rightarrow 0} \mu(\gamma^2) = C_{10} + \frac{2}{3} C_{01}.$$
